# Read: 05 - Operators and Loops
## * Comparison operators you can use them to evaluate the situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it may be and the result will be T/F . examples :
* **==** ( IS EQUAL TO ) Compare two values to see if they are the same.
* **!=**  (IS NOT EQUAL TO) Compare tow values to see if they are not the same.
* **===** (STRICT EQUAL TO )Compare the value and the data type to see if they are the same .
## * Logical operators  is used to compare the result of more than one comparison  operators like in the use of (IF or FOR), we have (AND,OR,NOT) the result of them will be (T/F) like the AND gate will give us true only if the two inputs are true .
## * Loops is a way to run the code inside it if the the result true and stop when it come to false, there is three type of loops :
 * **FOR :**  used to run the code fixed number of times depending on the counter wich is the condition ,it is the most used one.
*  **While :** used when we don't know how many loops we need.
* **DO WHILE :** the same as while but with main difference that the code will run one time no matter what happened with the condition.
