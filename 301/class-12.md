## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|---------------|-------------|
|SQL|NoSQL|
| called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)| called as non-relational or distributed database.|
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|have predefined schema for unstructured data | have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|vertically scalable |horizontally scalable |
|good fit for the complex query intensive environment |  not good fit for complex queries|

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

**When your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined.**

## Give a real world example

**Online stores, health care providers, clubs, libraries and video stores.**

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

1. Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema
2. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns
3. No complex queries, stored procedures, or views
4. High velocity transactions
5. Large volume of data (in Terabyte range) requiring quick and cheap scalability
6. Requires distributed computing and storage
7. No Data Warehouse, Analytics or BI use cases

## Give a real world example.

**Twitter,Facebook.**

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

**NoSQL databases.**

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

**SQL based databases.**
