# State and Props

## Component Lifecycle Events

**The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events,These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.**

**We have three phases of the component lifecycle.<br>1. Mounting(which is the first thing happened in the lifecycle of React).<br>2. Updating<br>3. Unmounting.**

**Thing in lifecycle happened in order:<br>1. Constructor.<br>2. Render.<br>3. React Updates.<br>4. ComponentDidMount.(used  load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM and it is good to set any subscriptions)<br>5. ComponentWillUnmount**

**`Cnstructor()`<br>The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.If the component is a subclass you should call super(props), or the props will be undefined and it can be used to assign state using `this.state`(avoid using it can lead to side effects).<br> EX:**

**`ComponentDidMount()`<br>This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted, we use it to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, `setState()` can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to performance issues.<br>This method is good  to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().**

## React State Vs Props

**State" is data that changes over the lifetime of a specific instance of a React component.**

**Props (short for Properties) is an object of inputs a React function component accepts as the first argument.**

**What types of things can you pass in the props?<br> We can pass values to children these values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.**

**What is the big difference between props and state?<br>State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function, While Props make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props. They are equivalent to function parameters.**

**When do we re-render our application?<br>Whenever there is a change in their state or props.**
**What are some examples of things that we could store in state?<br>State is data that changes over time for ex: Clock, temperature, counters**
