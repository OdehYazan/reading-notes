## Colors in the screen are mixed of the three basic colors if we change the amount of them we have different colors, as we know the screens pixels are mixed color light.
## Colors will make your web page alive and help you make the data more clear for users, we can specify the color by three ways :
**1. RBG values (RED,BLUE,GREEN) ex : 
color: rgb(100,100,90);**
**2. HEX codes : six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,green and blue in a color ex :
color:  #ee3e80;**
**3. color names (we have 147 name recognized) ex :
color: black;**
## CSS3 introduces new way to specify colors using hue, saturation,and lightness values
 
**1 .HUE we can imagine the colors as circle of degrees form 0 to 360.**
**2 .Saturationis the amount of gray in a color and represented as a percentage. **
**3 .Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color**
