## The Document Object Model (DOM)
 
 **DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window, The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript it is a separate set of rules it is implemented by all major browser makers and covers two primary areas:**

***1. MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE(DOM tree)<br>2. ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE(API)***
