## What makes some teams successes and others failures?

**Why can team dynamics be either energizing or draining? This article describes Google’s quest for a formula to optimize teamwork. Charles Duhigg, a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter for The New York Times, explains Google’s findings on its analysis of group dynamics. iferu recommends these insights to managers looking for methods to motivate teams, create a constructive working environment and improve group productivity.**

## What are the dynamics of effective teams?

**Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:<br>1.Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.<br>2.Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.<br>3.Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.<br>4.Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).<br>5.Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.**

## How to measure effectiveness?

**Using input from executives across the globe, the research team identified 180 teams to study (115 project teams in engineering and 65 pods in sales) which included a mix of high- and low-performing teams. The study tested how both team composition (e.g., personality traits, sales skills, demographics on the team) and team dynamics (e.g., what it was like to work with teammates) impact team effectiveness. Ideas were pulled from existing research as well as Google’s own experience with what makes an effective team.**

**They conducted hundreds of double-blind interviews with leaders to get a sense of what they thought drove team effectiveness. The researchers then looked at existing survey data, including over 250 items from the annual employee engagement survey and gDNA, Google’s longitudinal study on work and life, to see what variables might be related to effectiveness. Here are some sample items used in the study that participants were asked to agree or disagree with.**

- **Group dynamics: I feel safe expressing divergent opinions to the team.**

- **Skill sets: I am good at navigating roadblocks and barriers.**

- **Personality traits: I see myself as someone who is a reliable worker**

- **Emotional intelligence: I am not interested in other people’s problems**
