## HTML

***HTML pages are text documents ,HTML uses tag  (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning,Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag an closing tag in them we have Attributes require a name and a value,you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.***

## Extra Markup

***we need to know about some things like  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using, You can add comments to your code between the `<!--.....-->` and in html id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements or grope them to do changes like CSS style,The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together but the `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.***

## HTML5 Layout

***The new HTML5 elements use to defined
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure,the new elements provide clearer code (like the header ,body and footer instead of using multiple `<div>` elements ) but Older browsers do not understand HTML5 elements so  we need to identify the block-level elements, we have older IE do not understand HTML5 so we need extra JS available in google.***

## Process & Design

***It's important to understand which customers you want and what is there interest,and what is the thing that you will use to make them come again.***

***To create your web site you need to find the idea and draw it by two methods  Site maps and  Wireframes,
 Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page but the Design is different story,design is about interact with customers visually to make the information in your web more easy to understand by styling the text and colors.***
