## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

**First we have the Building Blocks, CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box <br> 1. Block-level elements , they start on new line (`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`).<br> 2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text (`<img> <b> <i>`).**

 **Containing Elements, If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element we usually group elemnts in `<div>` element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.**
