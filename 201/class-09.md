## Forms

**Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information, but in HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.**

 **A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.**

 ### Form Structure

 **Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. This element should always carr the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.**

 **`action` Every `<form>` element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.**

 **`method` Forms can be sent using one of two methods: `get` or `post`.**

 **`id`value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page(and is often used by scripts â€” such as those that check you have entered information into fields that require values).**
