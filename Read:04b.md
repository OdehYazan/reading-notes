## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

### The computer is machine take the information from the user (input) and store it in memory  thin the processor use algorithm to analyze it then send it to storage again  until it ready to sent to user  (output ) the output will be defernite depending on the purpose of the computer.

## How Computers Work: Binary & Data.
### Inside the computer are electric circuits only deal with on or of, this on or o give us the binary language the computers use to communicate (on is 1/ off is zero) which is a bit,  for these bits we have systems to handle it starting with binary to decimal and hex decimal, so every thing can be convert to 0 and 1 and vice versa.  

## How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic.
### there is a lot of circuits in the computer doing the processing inside your computer and these  are containing logic gates lots and lots of them doing different  tasks   each one of them do a one task depending in the 0/1 inputs like AND gate (only give 1 if the Both inputs are ones) combining these gates can give  more choices to process the data for the computers.
